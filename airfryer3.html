        <h4>Description of Air Fryer</h4>
        <p>An air fryer is a kitchen appliance that cooks by circulating hot air around the food. It is designed to simulate deep frying without submerging the food in oil. Air fryers use a combination of rapid air technology and a heating element to produce crispy, fried-like results with significantly less oil than traditional frying methods. They are popular for making healthier versions of fried foods such as French fries, chicken wings, and other snacks.</p>
